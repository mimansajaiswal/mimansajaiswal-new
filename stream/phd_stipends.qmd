subtitle: A response to the controversial idea that PhD students should barely scrape by in emergencies and rely on Blue Cupboard to feed themselves. 
description: "I recently received some criticism for my comments over the past couple of days, which seemed to justify the idea that PhD students don't need livable stipends. Let me make myself perfectly clear: that's bullshit. No one should have to choose between paying bills and getting essential medical care or feeding their pets. If you're one of those people who thinks barely scraping by is okay for PhD students, we don't see eye to eye."
