# Introduction

The world of deep learning model explanations presents us with a puzzle: how can we put our finger on the pulse of these explanations' efficacy evaluations when there is no clear, unanimous way to judge them? Amidst the array of unique methodologies and evaluation metrics adopted by diverse research papers, we find ourselves grappling with inconsistency. Consequently, drawing comparisons between different works becomes nearly impossible.

Recognizing the complexities of this issue, we set our sights on a key objective: to devise a standardized checklist, fine-tuned to address the myriad variables that sway the evaluation of deep learning model explanations. With the implementation of such a checklist, we aim to streamline the evaluation process, facilitating better understanding and comparison of results across various studies.

Diving in, it is essential to affirm that the current landscape of deep learning model explanations is flooded with a myriad of evaluation methods that lack any standardization. This chaotic environment poses a significant challenge for those attempting to draw parallels between diverse research papers. As individual studies employ their unique approaches and methodologies, the chances of establishing common ground for evaluation plummet.

Moreover, the criteria and metrics applied to assess explanations' utility in deep learning models differ considerably from one research paper to another. Some scholars might concentrate on the stability of explanations, evaluating their degree of consistency and reliability across different runs or datasets. Meanwhile, others can put a premium on the usability of explanations, factoring in aspects such as interpretability and user-friendliness. Performance metrics also come into play, as they are frequently employed to gauge the alignment between explanations and a model's predictions.

In light of these challenges and inconsistencies, we propose the development of a standardized checklist for assessing explanations in deep learning models. This comprehensive checklist would encompass a wide array of variables that shape the evaluation process. With all the necessary variables inmind, researchers can adopt a more consistent, systematic approach to scrutinize explanations, ultimately paving the way for better understanding and comparisons among diverse studies.

# The Core Idea

Navigating the complex world of deep learning model explanations, we face the problem of inconsistent evaluation methodologies and criteria. This obscurity challenges our ability to accurately assess the efficacy and reliability of model explanations. To tackle this issue, our research proposes the development of a comprehensive and well-rounded checklist, incorporating the critical variables that influence explanation evaluation. Through considering factors like input size, sample size, quantitative metrics, and their relationship with human ratings, we aim to build a strong foundation for evaluating explanations in deep learning models. This checklist will assist researchers and practitioners, offering a structured approach to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of explanations produced by deep learning models.

In crafting our proposed checklist, we emphasize the importance of recognizing various variables that can impact the evaluation process. First, considering the input size is crucial, as the complexity and dimensionality of the input data can greatly affect the comprehensibility of the explanations. Next, sample size used for evaluation plays a vital role in ensuring generalizability and reliability of the results, as diverse range of samples leads to a more accurate understanding of the model's capabilities.

# Experimentation Setup and Variations: A Balanced Assessment Framework

To create a standardized checklist for evaluating deep learning model explanations, it's important to define control factors and their variations, which affect evaluation outcomes. Key factors include the types of questions used for evaluation, selected based on task specificity and desired insights. Additionally, sample selection for evaluating explanations holds importance; samples need careful consideration to represent diverse scenarios and data distributions, ensuring comprehensive assessment of model performance. Furthermore, the evaluators' knowledge level can impact explanation interpretation and understanding, meriting attention for a balanced evaluation process.

Beyond these primary control factors, researchers should consider several secondary elements when developing the evaluation checklist. Model information availability, or priming, significantly influences explanation quality and reliability. Likewise, explanation method choice requires attention as different methods (e.g., attention mechanisms or gradient-based approaches) yield varied results and insights. Explanation characteristics, such as length, complexity, and linguistic style, are also important evaluation factors. Additionally, demographic factors like evaluator backgrounds and expertise play a role in explanation interpretation and perception. Lastly, the nature of the task being evaluated should be considered, since different tasks demand varied evaluation criteria and approaches. By systematically controlling and varying these factors, researchers can construct a comprehensive checklist addressing the range of variables affecting deep learning model explanation evaluations, while adhering to a research article's linguistic style.

## Types of Questions for Evaluation

Selecting appropriate questions for evaluation is essential for gauging the quality of explanations produced by deep learning models. To achieve a comprehensive evaluation, various question types that shed light on the model's understanding and decision-making process must be considered. These question categories can include aspects such as:

- Input comprehension: Assessing the model's ability to effectively interpret and extract relevant information from input data.

Incorporating these diverse question types enables researchers to gain a well-rounded understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, it aids in the development of a standardized checklist for evaluating explanations in deep learning models, promoting consistency and rigor in the assessment process.

## Selecting Samples to Evaluate Explanations

Picking appropriate samples for evaluating explanations is a critical component in the assessment process. Employing a variety of selection strategies can enhance the understanding of a model's explanatory capabilities across diverse situations. Consider the following approaches:

- Model-based uncertainty: Choose samples for which the model exhibits uncertainty, helping to analyze the model's explanations in ambiguous scenarios.
- Undersampling: Focus on samples from underrepresented classes or groups to evaluate the model's explanations for minority cases, thereby promoting fairness and robustness.
- Noisy labels: Opt for samples with noisy or incorrect labels to assess the model's ability to explain its decisions when faced with unreliable ground truth information.
- Misclassification: Include samples that the model misclassifies to gauge its explanatory capacity when it generates incorrect predictions.
- Data-based diversity: Select samples that represent diverse data points, which can provide insights into the model's generalizability across various input spaces.
- Density: Investigate both high-density (common) and low-density (unusual) samples to evaluate the model's explanations for different regions of the input space.
- Homogeneity: Assess samples from homogeneous groups to understand how the model disentangles and explains the decisions for similar instances.

Incorporating these selection strategies when evaluating explanations ensures a comprehensive assessment of the model's robustness and generalizability across different scenarios. This practice, in turn, aids in the development of a reliable and well-rounded evaluation checklist.

## Human Knowledge in Evaluating Explanations

Accounting for human knowledge is crucial when assessing explanations generated by deep learning models. Key factors influencing the evaluation process include:

- Familiarity with machine learning: Understanding basic concepts in machine learning and deep learning can impact how an evaluator interprets model explanations.
- Domain-specific knowledge: Possessing expertise in the field or subject area can facilitate deeper insights into the explanations and their relevance to domain-specific problems.
- Previous experience: An evaluator with prior experience assessing model explanations often has a more refined understanding of what constitutes a good explanation.
- Subject knowledge: A strong grasp of the subjects or concepts related to the task at hand influences the ability to evaluate the validity and coherence of explanations.

Engaging annotators with various expertise levels can lead to a broader understanding of the interpretability and accessibility of explanations. This diversity ensures that the evaluation process caters to different audiences, resulting in more accurate and inclusive assessments of deep learning models' explanatory proficiency.

## Model Information Known (Priming) in Evaluating Explanations

Priming, which involves sharing model information with evaluators, can significantly impact the evaluation process. By understanding how different levels of model information influence the perception and utility of explanations, researchers can establish a balanced assessment. Here are three priming variations to consider:

- No information: Withholding all model-related information from evaluators, which allows assessing explanations solely on their comprehensibility and informativeness without any bias or preconceived notions.

- Representative information: Providing evaluators with a basic understanding of the model, including its architecture, training method, and general performance. This approach helps evaluators contextualize the explanations and gain a general sense of the model's capabilities, while minimizing the risk of priming-induced bias.

- Asking for information: Encouraging evaluators to request specific model information as needed during the evaluation process. This setup lets evaluators actively seek out details that can help them better understand or interpret the explanations, thereby promoting a more personalized and targeted evaluation experience.

Incorporating these priming variations in the evaluation process allows researchers to determine the impact of prior model knowledge on the perception and usefulness of explanations. This information can further guide the development of a standardized checklist for evaluating deep learning model explanations more effectively.
