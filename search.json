Let me make myself perfectly clear: that's bullshit. No one should have to choose between paying bills and getting essential medical care or feeding their pets. If you're one of those people who thinks barely scraping by is okay for PhD students, we don't see eye to eye.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Finance\n        PhD\n        Academia\n        Opinion\n        Twitter\n        \n    \n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n Back to top"
