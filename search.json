    "text": "Hi, I’m Mimansa\nI’m Mimansa, a final year PhD candidate in Computer Science (AI/Interactive Systems) at the University of Michigan. I am fortunate to be working with Prof. Emily Provost as part of the CHAI group. I completed my undergrad in Computer Engineering from Institute of Engineering and Technology, Indore in 2017, and worked with Prof. G.L. Prajapati for my bachelor’s thesis.\nTl;dr: I work in the area of developing interpretable and human imitating evaluation and cost-effective data collection procedures. Along with the research in my PhD, I have interned at Allen AI NLP, Facebook AI Research (FAIR) NLP, and, Facebook Research Conversational AI conducting research on similar lines of interest."
