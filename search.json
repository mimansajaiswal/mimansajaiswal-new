    "text": "Hi, I’m Mimansa\nI’m Mimansa, a final year PhD candidate in Computer Science (AI/Interactive Systems) at the University of Michigan. I am fortunate to be working with Prof. Emily Provost as part of the CHAI group. I completed my undergrad in Computer Engineering from Institute of Engineering and Technology, Indore in 2017, and worked with Prof. G.L. Prajapati for my bachelor’s thesis.\nTl;dr: I work in the area of developing interpretable and human imitating evaluation and cost-effective data collection procedures. Along with the research in my PhD, I have interned at Allen AI NLP, Facebook AI Research (FAIR) NLP, and, Facebook Research Conversational AI conducting research on similar lines of interest."

This paper proposes a template formulation that derives human-centered, automatic, optimizable evaluation metrics for emotion recognition models. The template uses model explanations and sociolinguistic wordlists and can be applied to a sample or whole dataset. The proposed metrics include generalizability and debiasing improvement, and are tested on three models, datasets and sensitive variables. The metrics correlate with the models' performance and biased representations, and can be used to train models with increased generalizability, decreased bias, or both. The template is the first to provide quantifiable metrics for training and evaluating generalizability and bias in emotion recognition models.\n                        \n                        \n                           PDF\n                        \n                     \n            \n         \n         \n            \n               2020\n            \n            \n               ACL-SRW\n            \n            \n               \n                  Noise-Based Augmentation Techniques for Emotion Datasets: What do we Recommend?\n               \n               In\n                     ACL-SRW,\n                        2020\n                  \n               \n               \n                  Mimansa Jaiswal, Emily Mower Provost\n               \n                  \n                        \n                           Data Augmentation\n                        \n                        \n                           Emotion Recognition\n                        \n                        \n                           Speech and Audio\n                        \n                        \n                           Empirical Analysis\n                        \n                  \n                     \n                        \n                           Multiple noise-based data augmentation approaches have been proposed to counteract this challenge in other speech domains.

In this work, we propose a set of recommendations for noise-based augmentation of emotion datasets based on human and machine performance evaluation of generated realistic noisy samples using multiple categories of environmental and synthetic noise.\n                        \n                        \n                           PDF\n                              Talk\n                        \n                     \n            \n         \n         \n            \n               May 2020\n            \n            \n               LREC\n            \n            \n               \n                  MuSE: Multimodal Stressed Emotion Dataset\n               \n               In\n                     LREC,\n                        May 2020\n                  \n               \n               \n                  Mimansa Jaiswal, Cristian-Paul Bara, Yuanhang Luo, Rada Mihalcea, Mihai Burzo, Emily Mower Provost\n               \n                  \n                        \n                           Data Collection\n                        \n                        \n                           Confounding Factors\n                        \n                        \n                           Emotion Recognition\n                        \n                        \n                           Speech and Audio\n                        \n                  \n                     \n                        \n                           This paper presents a dataset, Multimodal Stressed Emotion (MuSE), to study the multimodal interplay between the presence of stress and expressions of affect.
