  <title>What is the cheapest and easiest way to create AND maintain a personal academic website?</title>
  <link>https://mimansajaiswal.github.io/personal_notes/personal_academic_website.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>Another week of personal website debate on Twitter, another set of heavy compilation based suggestions to create and maintain a personal website. So, I decided to take a look at all the recent website builders and provide a set of recommendations. If you do not want to read this in entirety, my suggestions can be summarized below:</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Summary of available website building options: sorted from most to least recommended. Use:
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><em>This document only talks about the first 4 options.</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Montaigne if you want the easiest option ever. (Apple Notes only, you can use icloud Apple Notes)</p></li>
<li><p>Notion to Astro, if you want to write in Notion, and are okay setting up github actions once for automatic deployment.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> (how <a href="https://github.com/mimansajaiswal/mimansajaiswal.github.io">this website</a> is made) if you want heavy LaTeX support and the ability to embed runnable visualizations/code in your document.</p></li>
<li><p>Git Based CMS if you want to host the static site elsewhere, but sync the content (editable in wysiwyg) with github.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://sites.google.com/">Google Sites</a> if you are okay with your data not being portable, but want a quick editing experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> with <a href="https://getdarkmatter.dev/">Dark Matter</a> (ping on <a href="https://twitter.com/vadimdemedes/status/1681051391186329603">twitter</a> for access) if you are proficient with writing main page content in HTML (you might get lucky with all .md based tempaltes like <a href="https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/joshuakgoldberg-dot-com">this one</a>), but want to write blog posts/collections in markdown. Suggested themes: <a href="https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper">Astro Paper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus">Astro Cactus</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://editable.website/">editable.website</a> if you want to edit the website easily, but are willing to spend time on the <a href="https://github.com/michael/editable-website#deployment-to-flyio">first setup on fly.io</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (for example <a href="https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod">Paper Mod</a>) if you trust yourself to keep up with the process required to maintain this website.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are many paid options that do something similar. I can’t recommend them though, because custom domains already cost $10-$25 per year. While an additional $2-$4/mo might be nothing to you, it is an expense that many students do not want to have. If you are okay with paying though, and want something that is easy as the above options, and does the hosting for you, check out <a href="https://blot.im/">blot.im</a>. You can create a website from a bunch of folders hosted anywhere, including drive and dropbox, and works with all kinds of files – including google docs, removing the need for a special visual editor.</p>

<p>I knew about montaigne for around 4 months, but never gave it a serious look. Who wants a website made out of their Apple Notes, with no customization and not much to look at? Oh well, I was wrong!</p>
<section id="example-website" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-website">Example Website</h2>
<p><a href="https://mimansajaiswal.montaigne.io/">Here is the website</a> I made using montaigne. Man, it works! There is nothing missing in it, that I would need on a personal website! Sure, it does not have comments using giscus as I do, but who really needs that? Yes, the domain is hard to spell, but, the developer very kindly offered a pay what you want pricing for custom domains. Yes, you cannot host it on github, but the content is all in Apple Notes. The day montaigne goes down, you will still have all your content with you and be able to port it elsewhere.</p>
<p>If you want to figure out what the source notes requires or needs, I even made the folder of notes that I use to create the website public (<a href="https://www.icloud.com/notes/015MtzesWUvmeenWEvIgjN2-g#mimansajaiswal.montaigne">Link</a>).</p>

<section id="supported-content" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="supported-content">Supported Content</h2>
<p>What all can you do using Apple Notes? Well a ton! You can customize your menu, headers etc. You can use images, videos, embeds, headings that have anchors. Take a look <a href="https://mimansajaiswal.montaigne.io/research-notes/new-research-note">here</a>! Yes, the tags are clickable and filterable! You can do folders. It comes integrated with an RSS feed, quick links to your profiles in the footer, and a QR code to add on your research posters for someone to quick access your personal website. You can also create links to other apple notes using Shortcuts or <a href="https://mac.montaigne.io/">this MacOS app</a>. From iOS 17 and MacOS 14 onwards, native linking is available inside the app.</p>

<section id="tldr" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>
<p>Honestly, I cannot recommend this option enough. The domain would cost you a bit (maybe $10/year), if you go the custom domain route, but the ease of updating your website in a second beats any other options.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are okay with one time setup of github actions and github environment variables, this would be my recommended go to option. You can point it to a <code>username.github.io</code> domain or add a custom domain. You can deploy manually or on a cron schedule.</p>

<p>Many of us now write in Notion. Yes, github static pages exist, but they aren’t collaborative, they are a pain to edit, they aren’t visual enough, you cannot talk through comments (no, I do not want to read through issues for a blog post, thank you).</p>
<p>Notion to Astro solves all of that. It gives you a writing environment in Notion, but renders it as a website through Astro. It allows you for ample customization by customizing the astro files and the associated CSS unlike montaigne.</p>
<section id="example-website-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-website-1">Example Website</h2>
<p>The default notion to astro effort is rendering of a collection on the main page. The only problem with that structure is that most of us have an index file that is a list of things we do, and then a blog post. Many academic websites have no blog posts. So, I modified the template to suit the general style of academic websites. You can play around with it <a href="https://mimansajaiswal.github.io/demo-astro-notion-blog/">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few other additions too! I really loved the <a href="https://astro-theme-cactus.netlify.app/">Astro Cactus theme</a> and the search functionality it provides. So, I used their code for <a href="https://pagefind.app/">Pagefind</a> and integrated it into the original source code. If you are someone who is okay with editing JS files directly or proficient with Astro, you can find that theme <a href="https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus">here</a>. Another theme I will suggest for people who want to create in Astro rather than in Hugo/Jekyll is <a href="https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper">Astro Paper</a>. Astro cactus did not have giscus. And I wanted giscus, because that is what I am using for my current websites, and I’ll explain my workflow in detail in the [#Quarto] section, but if everything aligns, I will happily switch to using this method. So, I integrated giscus based off this <a href="https://github.com/piero-vic/pierolescano.com">repo</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a hacked together repo, because I understand code, but I do not have it in me to figure out how astro works. No, GPT4 did not help much with the understanding part of the equation. Notion to Astro off the shelf also supports google analytics, so that is always a plus.</p>
</section>
<section id="supported-content-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="supported-content-1">Supported Content</h2>
<p>Notion supports a ton of stuff, and so does the original repo from Otoyo. Here is the <a href="https://astro-notion-blog.pages.dev/posts/supported-blocks/">original page</a> of supported content. In comparison to montaigne, it supports a ton of extra blocks, just because it is based off Notion (Apple Notes is feature limited, not montaigne’s fault in this case). Specifically, as extras, it supports twitter embeds, link previews and bookmarks, code blocks with syntax highlights, synced blocks, toggles, files, callouts and highlights!</p>
</section>
<section id="tldr-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr-1">tl;dr</h2>
<p>If you are comfortable with github at all, and are okay setting up actions and environment variables (and creating an integration key in Notion), I will suggest this option. It is a one time option, it never needs to be touched again in a code format, it requires no push and pull. And if you are worried about what happens when Notion goes down, you can export your content in .md files and host it elsewhere 5 years later. As I said, this document is meant for pseudo-owning your content and convenience/accessibility. It ain’t meant for “what happens when Notion no longer exists in 10 years, and my exports are not perfect”.</p>

<p><strong>Demo Source Code</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/mimansajaiswal/mimansajaiswal.github.io">Github Repo</a></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are okay with editing your website completely in markdown online, or creating a mirrored local repo and using the visual editor for Quarto in VS Code, then pushing the changes to github, you will do fine with Quarto. You almost always do not need such a complicated website, and it requires a ton of CSS to make it look good (feel free to copy mine), but it works with YAML and that is immensely useful, especially for stuff like papers (<a href="https://github.com/mimansajaiswal/mimansajaiswal.github.io/blob/master/papers.yaml">example</a>) or experience (<a href="https://github.com/mimansajaiswal/mimansajaiswal.github.io/blob/master/about_me/experience.yaml">example</a>) that you just need to keep adding.</p>

<p>Quarto in general is awesome! It is easy to maintain, easy to deploy etc. You can edit in markdown mode online using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor">github.dev</a>. It has a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/vscode/">visual editor</a> if you sync the repo to your local computer. And honestly, that is not bad. It definitely suffers from being markdown based, i.e., if you need to do anything more than write content with basic formatting that CommonMark supports, you end up with class notations being in your .md files. So much for portable files, right?</p>
<section id="example-website-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-website-2">Example Website</h2>
<p>The website you are reading it on, was built using quarto. The good part is, it works with YAML and .ejs files; and if you find a template you like, you can just edit the YAML to generate a listing or a HTML component. This is what has made me stick to quarto over other markdown based website editing options. YAML is immensely useful, especially for stuff like papers (<a href="https://github.com/mimansajaiswal/mimansajaiswal.github.io/blob/master/papers.yaml">example</a>) or experience (<a href="https://github.com/mimansajaiswal/mimansajaiswal.github.io/blob/master/about_me/experience.yaml">example</a>) that you just need to keep adding or editing. Now, on the other hand, creating the .ejs files and the associated CSS required a ton of work, but if you like what you see on this site, feel free to copy <a href="https://mimansajaiswal.github.io/">mine</a>.</p>
<p>Quarto is built off bootstrap, so it supports all classes that bootstrap has. That lends itself quite nicely to arranging content, or creating more complex sites, if need be. The comment option here is added through <a href="https://giscus.app/">giscus</a>. Quarto off the shelf also supports google analytics, so that is always a plus.</p>
</section>
<section id="supported-content-2" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="supported-content-2">Supported Content</h2>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Quarto supports all kinds of content, some through its internal modifications, and some through shortcodes or plugins. Some of the features I really like are footnotes<sup>1</sup> that show on hover and expanding table of contents (you can see it in action, if you open this post on desktop). It supports <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html">callouts</a>, both in collapsible and expanded state. It supports side margin content, similar to footnotes, that I love to use to add more context. The side margin content automatically gets appended to main content on narrow devices. You can embed social media content using plugins. You can also add a lightbox functionality, especially if you add a lot of diagrams to your post and want them to be clickable and zoomable. You can add font awesome icon <i class="fa-solid fa-moon" aria-label="moon"></i> in middle of the sentence which looks way better than adding emojis 🌔. Here are the extensions I use for Quarto: <a href="https://github.com/quarto-ext/lightbox">Lightbox</a>, <a href="https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome">Font Awesome</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sellorm/quarto-social-embeds/tree/main/_extensions/social-embeds">Social Embeds</a>, <a href="https://github.com/shafayetShafee/collapse-social-embeds">Collapse Social Embeds</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mloubout/critic-markup">Critic Markup</a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;This is footnote content that shows on hover! I can now speak on tangent without affecting the flow of the paragraph. Remember that the hover concept only works on desktop, but that is fine, who needs to read my tangential thoughts on mobile. The post is long enough in itself.</p></li></div></div>
<p>While Quarto natively supports adding images and videos, you need to add them to a folder, and then insert using the visual editor into your note. You can add using the browse option and it auto adds the file to the images folder, but if you rename the image file name, it does not auto connect and rename the connection in the post, not my idea of fun. You cannot do columns in Quarto in the visual mode. Because of these limitations, I have been writing posts in Notion and then converting them to qmd using <a href="https://github.com/innolitics/n2y">n2y</a> (or Notion to YAML). And this is the reason why I would prefer to be able to switch to Notion to Astro, because this convoluted process is no fun!</p>
<p>You can add runnable code cells in Quarto though, and none of the options mentioned here can do that, and if that is something you are looking for, especially for Data Viz people, nothing comes close.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr-2">tl;dr</h2>
<p>So, why do I not recommend it enough? Shortcodes, or margin content using bootstrap classes is no one’s idea of fun (or maybe it is). And I really do not want to add images first to the folder and then using markdown (or add to the folder and then insert using the visual editor). Quarto also has seriously slow loading times on mobile. But if these things are not a problem for you, and you want something that is capable enough, but still works with markdown, you should use Quarto (you can use my theme or a million others!).</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This kind of deployment is called git based CMS. The idea is that people can edit it using git versioning systems or online. There are of course many options that I found: <a href="https://decapcms.org/">Decap CMS</a>, <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/">Cloud Cannon</a>, <a href="https://tina.io/">tina</a>, <a href="https://contentrain.io/">Contentrain</a> and <a href="https://craftercms.org/">Crafter</a>. I tested some of these and a few others. For example, <a href="https://www.siteleaf.com/">siteleaf</a> is something I would not recommend; just because how frustrating it is to get it to run on a https:// server. The two <strong>I would recommend</strong> are <a href="https://decapcms.org/">Decap CMS</a> and <a href="https://tina.io/">tina</a>, because they are open source, highly customizable, generous free plans, and provide local as well as cloud installations.</p>
<p>Most git CMS based templates (for example, <a href="https://github.com/gxanshu/astro-decap-cms-starter">this portfolio template</a>) only allow you to edit the contents or blog posts in a visual manner or through CMS and at that point, I would suggest you to use Quarto instead. Because what people are mostly editing is the index, and not necessarily the blogpost content. Most academics don’t write blogposts at all and what good is a WYSIWYG solution if you are writing arrays to update your paper listings. This is the only reason Git based CMS is below Quarto in terms of simplicity.</p>
<section id="example-website-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-website-3">Example Website</h2>
<p>Most default templates that are associated with any of these CMS systems, come with the prerequisite of editing not the index content but instead collections (similar to any WYSIWYG editor for Astro). I found a few templates that allow you to edit the front page content too and you can see some setup demos here. <a href="https://tina.io/">tina</a>’s <a href="https://app.tina.io/quickstart">default option</a> is a completely editable website, and I recommend it.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Creating and editing a personal website using Tina CMS with git workflow.</figcaption>

<p>For decap, I found two good options of templates that allowed to edit the base pages as well as the blog posts: <a href="https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate">Eleventy Starter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake/">Gatsby Starter</a>. There is a <a href="https://github.com/decaporg/one-click-hugo-cms">Hugo Starter</a> template as well if you really love Hugo.</p>

<p>As always, you can use custom domains with tina or netlify cms to have a better domain name.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr-3">tl;dr</h2>
<p>If you are looking for something that just works like Wordpress and are okay with a limited range of templates, go ahead and try git based CMS platforms. Some of these are open source, some are proprietary; and some sync the built static site back to github while others don’t. Ideally you want to pick the ones that sync the static site back or at least the content back to github, especially for portability reasons, otherwise, you are better off using just Google Sites.</p>

<section id="tldr-4" class="level1">
<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>For most people Montaigne is enough! And this is the option I recommend to most people who do not use git in their day to day life (and have an icloud account). If you are willing to dabble into some git technicalities, go with Notion to Astro. Want a deeply integrated CMS system, especially if you write a lot of blog posts, go with Git Based CMS. If you want some support for callouts, embeds, but are okay with using shortcodes and tend to do more technical writing, go with Quarto. If you are proficient enough in web development to edit HTML, do not care much about losing content if Google Sites goes down or want 100 of well crafted templates that are still hard to edit visually and require commands, check out options 5-8 in Summary of available website building options: sorted from most to least recommended. Use:. If you do not want to write markdown or shortcodes to include a video in your post, stick to Montaigne or Notion to Astro.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>On a daily basis, I use multiple apps and I prefer to put them together here. In general, I am always looking for better note-taking apps, and if you have any suggestions, I would love to know (trust me, I have tried 800 of them!). I will divide this into different categories of software I use, in case they are helpful for anyone.</p>

<p>For some context, I use a M1 Pro, Macbook Pro, with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. Some of these applications might not be great on 8GB RAM or 128GB SSD, so proceed with discretion.</p>

<li><p><strong>Communication</strong>: <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/spark2">Spark Email 2</a> is my email client of choice rather than using the general Apple mail client. Why?

It also does basic Newsletters and Pins options for each email account, that Apple mail does not. To have all the DMs in one place, I use <a href="https://texts.com/">Texts</a>.

<li><p><strong>Tasks</strong>: I use <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a>. I have used 100 other apps, but I keep coming back to Todoist. With their quick capture being all bang based, nothing is easier for me to quick capture, schedule, rescheduled, completed. It syncs with Google Calendar. It works in collaboration mode. This is the only task tracker that has worked for me.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Terminal</strong>: <a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp</a> as terminal. I do not work with vim, so take my advice with a grain of salt. But I really like block based terminals. It also has a bang based AI mode. You can type <code>#</code> to ask it to provide the command that <code>converts all images in this folder and sub-folders to .webp and delete the original versions</code> and it will provide you with the command with templated tab-able arguments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sticky Notes</strong>: <a href="https://numi.app/">Numi</a> is the app I use for pasting on always on top notes. It is also great for calculations inside notes. It is extremely expensive, so probably get it on sale rather than anytime else, would be my recommendation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calendar and Timers</strong>: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dato/id1470584107">Dato</a> is for calendar and meetings. It shows the meeting time and current time across timezones, shows a monthly calendar, has an option to join a meeting from the menu bar. The reason I use it over <a href="https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/">itsycal</a> is for its full screen notifications because I otherwise forget the meeting time or join a minute or two late. If you do not need that or timezones, itsycal is free and does everything else. I also use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/day-progress/id6450280202">Day Progress</a> because I am time-blind, but most people would not need it. I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/red-hot-timer/id929960914">Timer RH</a> for always on top timers for timed tasks. It connects with the calendar as well, is pretty easy to set rather than using a Siri command (just drag the menu bar icon down to however long you need the timer to be).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Note taking</strong>: I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aiko/id1672085276">Aiko</a> at the moment for transcription of my blabberings, <a href="https://app.tactiq.io/">Tactiq</a> for remote meetings, and <a href="https://otter.ai/">Otter</a> for in person meetings. For long form note taking, I use <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> at the moment, but it is not necessarily my tool of choice, given its poor AI integration that would allow me to go from unstructured to structured content. It also lacks a calendar integration and spatial system, so I am always on a lookout for something different. Some other softwares I am exploring are <a href="https://tana.inc/">Tana</a> (better AI and API integration), <a href="https://capacities.io/">Capacities</a> (no collaboration), <a href="https://heptabase.com/">Heptabase</a> (no collaboration) and <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/docs/">Google Workspace</a> (no block based editing but has newly added chips, task management, linking previews etc). I use <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com/">Goodnotes</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109">Apple Notes</a> for handwritten note taking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reference management</strong>: I used to use <a href="https://paperpile.com/">Paperpile</a> but I shifted to using Notion for this purpose because I could not make use of the highlighted information. I use either <a href="https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/">ar5iv</a> or <a href="https://papertohtml.org/">Paper To HTML</a> to snip papers into notion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Whiteboarding</strong>: I use <a href="https://www.guga.co/">Guga</a> (new app, chinese support) or <a href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a> (expensive but works really well, has a teams version). I tried <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freeform/id6443742539">Freeform</a> and did not like it much. Guga also does not have desktop support which kinda hampers its usage on my end.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reading</strong>: I use <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Reader from Readwise</a>, they allow you to annotate pdfs, videos webpages, add highlights, add notes to highlights etc. It is cheap for students; syncs highlights from everywhere to Notion and works reliably. The two other options are <a href="https://omnivore.app/">Omnivore</a> (open source and free) and <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/">Matter</a> (better and more intuitive design but does not work with pdfs or videos). For podcasts, because apparently the information now also comes from podcasts, I use <a href="https://www.snipd.com/">Snipd</a>, which has headphone button based sniping, AI snip boundaries and snip summaries, and also syncs to Readwise or separately to Notion.</p></li>

<section id="creative-work" class="level1">
<h1>Creative Work</h1>
<p>I divide creative work into 2 parts, sometimes overlapping, creative work as an hobby, creative work for my research.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flowcharts</strong>: <a href="https://whimsical.com/">Whimsical</a> and <a href="flowchart.fun">flowchart.fun</a>. Whimsical is great for making beautiful handmade flowcharts or making flowcharts easily using AI. Flowchart.fun provides a simple language to create flowcharts by just writing text.</li>
<li><strong>Screenshots</strong>: <a href="https://shottr.cc/">Shottr</a> allows to create annotated screenshots, blur parts of image on device. It also allows for rolling screenshots where if you capture an area it will auto scroll the webpage or any other document for you. Shottr is free and is extremely cheap for pro version (which is only needed for not getting pinged for updating after 30 days). I use <a href="https://pika.style/">pika</a> for pretty backgrounds around screenshots.</li>
<li><strong>Screen recordings</strong>: Explaining a coding process or a step-by-step guide on about how to do something, we often end up with full screen videos with tiny text. I use <a href="screen.studio">screen.studio</a> or <a href="https://screenrun.app/">screenrun</a> for automatic zoom ins into where I am clicking or typing. Screenrun can also do a short video from a screenshot if you want to say, oh, click here and then here and then here.</li>
<li><strong>Paper diagrams</strong>: <a href="draw.io">draw.io</a> for making neural network diagrams. There is unfortunately nothing that comes close. I cannot do TikZ, but if you can, more power to you!</li>
<li><strong>Drawing</strong>: I use <a href="https://procreate.com/">Procreate</a> or <a href="https://concepts.app/en/">Concepts</a>. Procreate allows for really intuitive drawing interface whereas concepts is vector based, and still allows for all the flair with layers, brushes, objects etc.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="works-in-background" class="level1">
<h1>Works in Background</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Memory</strong>: <a href="Rewind.ai">Rewind.ai</a> has been a life-saver for me, it records everything on screen, and records laptop audio and mic if you choose to. It has two main things: search rewind and ask rewind. Search rewind is a simple keyword search over everything that has been stored. Ask rewind sends everything in those clips to OpenAI (possibly GPT3.5 16k) to create a summary and adds “screenshot” references.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shortcuts</strong>: <a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a> allows for doing so many things that I do not know how to describe it. It is local first and is free. It also has a pro subscription if you need its AI chat options (which comes with a student discount). The best way I have seen it described is Spotlight++ but I never used spotlight. You can use <code>⌘+Space</code> to do calculations, timezone conversions, unit conversions, quick word lookup, file search, screenshot search etc.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">

<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Amphetamine and Other Menu Bar Apps
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>You can also remove the amphetamine software you have and use the menu bar coffee app that Raycast provides. It comes with many extensions, such as, hypersonic that can connect to any notion database of yours to show tasks, schedule them etc, all from <code>⌘+Space</code> or from your menu bar.</p>
<p>Another menu bar app that I use from Raycast is Text Shortcuts which allows you to select any task, and convert case, URL encode and decode, convert to markdown, find text statistics (word counter, character counter) etc.</p>
</div>
</div></li>
<li><p><strong>Camera</strong>: This is a small software, but I have cats, and I have messy hair. I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1632827132">Camera Preview</a> a ton both for checking on myself and using the return key to click photos. <a href="https://handmirror.app/">Hand mirror</a> is the alternate option, but it cannot click photos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Utilities</strong>: I use <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a> for arranging my menu bar, especially with that notch on Macbook pro. I use <a href="https://folivora.ai/">Better Touch Tool</a> to assign taps to clicks (for example three finger tap to open in a new tab). I also use it to assign hyperkey. Hyperkey is when you press all meta keys together on the keyboard. For example, Hyperkey+A is my shortcut for quick task in Todoist. I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1662213547">WeatherX</a> to have weather of 4 cities be readily accessible in the menu bar. I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/command-x/id6448461551">Command+X</a> to have a cut option in MacOS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI Chat Interfaces</strong>: I use <a href="https://boltai.app/">Bolt AI</a> at the moment to organize my conversations, especially those that need to go through API for non-training purposes. There are 100 such apps, this is the one I found the earliest. If I do end up paying for <a href="https://www.raycast.com/pro">Raycast Pro</a>, then I would not need this app. I use Bolt because, it does not show up in dock, allows to select models per chat, allows to set shortcut to bring it up. I sometimes use <a href="https://chatgpt-sidebar.com/">Sider</a> (on browser) and <a href="https://www.macgpt.com/">MacGPT</a> (quick question - synonym for X) too.</p></li>
