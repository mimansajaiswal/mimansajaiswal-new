On a daily basis, I use multiple apps and I prefer to put them together here. In general, I am always looking for better note-taking apps, and if you have any suggestions, I would love to know (trust me, I have tried 800 of them!). I will divide this into different categories of software I use, in case they are helpful for anyone.

## Incomplete Post

This is incomplete and I will be filling it over the next few weeks.
:::

For some context, I use a M1 Pro, Macbook Pro, with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. Some of these applications might not be great on 8GB RAM or 128GB SSD, so proceed with discretion.

# Creative Work

I divide creative work into 2 parts, sometimes overlapping, creative work as an hobby, creative work for my research.

## For any task

-   Flowcharts: [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) and [flowchart.fun](flowchart.fun). Whimsical is great for making beautiful handmade flowcharts or making flowcharts easily using AI. Flowchart.fun provides a simple language to create flowcharts by just writing text.
-   [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/) allows to create annotated screenshots, blur parts of image on device. It also allows for rolling screenshots where if you capture an area it will auto scroll the webpage or any other document for you. Shottr is free and is extremely cheap for pro version (which is only needed for not getting pinged for updating after 30 days).

## Just for work

-   Paper diagrams: [draw.io](draw.io) for making neural network diagrams. There is unfortunately nothing that comes close. I cannot do TikZ, but if you can, more power to you!

## Just for hobby

-   Screen recordings: Explaining a coding process or a step-by-step guide on about how to do something, we often end up with full screen videos with tiny text. I use [screen.studio](screen.studio) or [screenrun](https://screenrun.app/) for automatic zoom ins into where I am clicking or typing. Screenrun can also do a short video from a screenshot if you want to say, oh, click here and then here and then here.

# Works in Background

-   [Rewind.ai](Rewind.ai) has been a life-saver for me, it records everything on screen, and records laptop audio and mic if you choose to. It has two main things: search rewind and ask rewind. Search rewind is a simple keyword search over everything that has been stored. Ask rewind sends everything in those clips to OpenAI (possibly GPT3.5 16k) to create a summary and adds "screenshot" references.

-   [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) allows for doing so many things that I do not know how to describe it. It is local first and is free. It also has a pro subscription if you need its AI chat options (which comes with a student discount). The best way I have seen it described is Spotlight++ but I never used spotlight. You can use `⌘+Space` to do calculations, timezone conversions, unit conversions, quick word lookup, file search, screenshot search etc.

    ## Amphetamine and Other Menu Bar Apps

    You can also remove the amphetamine software you have and use the menu bar coffee app that Raycast provides. It comes with many extensions, such as, hypersonic that can connect to any notion database of yours to show tasks, schedule them etc, all from `⌘+Space` or from your menu bar.

    Another menu bar app that I use from Raycast is Text Shortcuts which allows you to select any task, and convert case, URL encode and decode, convert to markdown, find text statistics (word counter, character counter) etc.

# Productivity Software

-   [Spark Email 2](https://sparkmailapp.com/spark2) is my email client of choice rather than using the general Apple mail client. Why? Because it has the ability to remove Updates/Promotions/Forums from my main inbox that Apple mail does not. It also does basic Newsletters and Pins options for each email account, that Apple mail does not.

-   For tasks, I use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/). I have used 100 other apps, but I keep coming back to Todoist. With their quick capture being all bang based, nothing is easier for me to quick capture, schedule, rescheduled, completed. It syncs with Google Calendar. It works in collaboration mode. This is the only task tracker that has worked for me.

-   [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) as terminal. I do not work with vim, so take my advice with a grain of salt. But I really like block based terminals. It also has a bang based AI mode. You can type `#` to ask it to provide the command that `converts all images in this folder and sub-folders to .webp and delete the original versions` and it will provide you with the command with templated tab-able arguments.
