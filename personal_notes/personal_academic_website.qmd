Another week of personal website debate on Twitter, another set of heavy compilation based suggestions to create and maintain a personal website. So, I decided to take a look at all the recent website builders and provide a set of recommendations. If you do not want to read this in entirety, my suggestions can be summarized below:

::: callout-note
## Summary of available website building options: sorted from most to least recommended

This document only talks about the first 4 options.

1.  Use [Montaigne] if you want the easiest option ever. (Apple Notes only, you can use icloud Apple Notes)

2.  Use [Notion to Astro], if you want to write in Notion, and are okay setting up github actions once for automatic deployment.

3.  Use [decapcms](https://decapcms.org/) if you want to set up the website on netifly, and then edit the content anytime in wysiwyg structure.

4.  Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (how [this website](https://github.com/mimansajaiswal/mimansajaiswal.github.io) is made) if you want heavy LaTeX support and the ability to embed runnable visualizations/code in your document.

5.  Use [editable.website](https://editable.website/) if you want to edit the website easily, but are willing to spend time on the first setup on fly.io.

6.  Use [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/) if you are okay with your data not being portable, but want a quick editing experience.

7.  Use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (for example [Paper Mod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)) if you trust yourself to keep up with the process required to maintain this website.

# Montaigne

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
**Website**: [montaigne](https://montaigne.io/)

**Note**: The developer has kindly suggested that they would be willing to a `pay-what-you-want` option for students who use montaigne and need to point it to a custom domain. Their pricing suggests it is \$2/mo, but please contact them over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/montaigne_io) or [email](mailto:hello@montaigne.io) for subsidized custom domain pricing.

I knew about montaigne for around 4 months, but never gave it a serious look. Who wants a website made out of their Apple Notes, with no customization and not much to look at? Oh well, I was wrong!

## Example Website

[Here is the website](https://mimansajaiswal.montaigne.io/) I made using montaigne. Man, it works! There is nothing missing in it, that I would need on a personal website! Sure, it does not have comments using giscus as I do, but who really needs that? Yes, the domain is hard to spell, but, the developer very kindly offered a pay what you want pricing for custom domains. Yes, you cannot host it on github, but the content is all in Apple Notes. The day montaigne goes down, you will still have all your content with you and be able to port it elsewhere.

If you want to figure out what the source notes requires or needs, I even made the folder of notes that I use to create the website public ([Link](https://www.icloud.com/notes/015MtzesWUvmeenWEvIgjN2-g#mimansajaiswal.montaigne)).

## Supported Content

What all can you do using Apple Notes? Well a ton! You can customize your menu, headers etc. You can use images, videos, embeds, headings that have anchors. Take a look [here](https://mimansajaiswal.montaigne.io/research-notes/new-research-note)! Yes, the tags are clickable and filterable! You can do folders. It comes integrated with an RSS feed, quick links to your profiles in the footer, and a QR code to add on your research posters for someone to quick access your personal website.

## tl;dr

Honestly, I cannot recommend this option enough. The domain would cost you a bit (maybe \$10/year), if you go the custom domain route, but the ease of updating your website in a second beats any other options.

# Notion to Astro

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Website**:

**My Fork**: [Demo Astro Notion Blog Github Source](https://github.com/mimansajaiswal/demo-astro-notion-blog)

**Note**: If you are okay with one time setup of github actions and github environment variables, this would be my recommended go to option. You can point it to a `username.github.io` domain or add a custom domain. You can deploy manually or on a cron schedule.

**Demo Website**: [Demo Website Using Astro Notion](https://mimansajaiswal.github.io/demo-astro-notion-blog/)

Many of us now write in Notion. Yes, github static pages exist, but they aren't collaborative, they are a pain to edit, they aren't visual enough, you cannot talk through comments (no, I do not want to read through issues for a blog post, thank you).

Notion to Astro solves all of that. It gives you a writing environment in Notion, but renders it as a website through Astro. It allows you for ample customization by customizing the astro files and the associated CSS unlike montaigne.
