  description: Multiple noise-based data augmentation approaches have been proposed to counteract this challenge in other speech domains. But, unlike speech recognition and speaker verification, the underlying label of emotion data may change given the addition of noise. In this work, we propose a set of recommendations for noise-based augmentation of emotion datasets based on human and machine performance evaluation of generated realistic noisy samples using multiple categories of environmental and synthetic noise.

  description: Metrics for emotion recognition can be challenging due to their dependence on subjective human perception. This paper proposes a template formulation that derives human-centered, automatic, optimizable evaluation metrics for emotion recognition models. The template uses model explanations and sociolinguistic wordlists and can be applied to a sample or whole dataset. The proposed metrics include generalizability and debiasing improvement, and are tested on three models, datasets and sensitive variables. The metrics correlate with the models' performance and biased representations, and can be used to train models with increased generalizability, decreased bias, or both. The template is the first to provide quantifiable metrics for training and evaluating generalizability and bias in emotion recognition models.

  description: Mental health professionals assess symptom severity through semi-structured clinical interviews. During these interviews, they observe their patients’ spoken behaviors, including both what the patients say and how they say it. In this work, we move beyond acoustic and lexical information, investigating how higher-level interactive patterns also change during mood episodes.

  description: Emotion expression and perception are inherently subjective. There is generally not a single annotation that can be unambiguously declared “correct.” As a result, annotations are colored by the manner in which they were collected, i.e., with or without context.

  categories: [Emotion Recognition, Mental Health, Text, Speech and Audio, Metric Design]
  description: Emotion is expressed through language, vocal and facial expressions. Lack of emotional alignment between modalities is a symptom of mental disorders. We propose to quantify the mismatch between emotion expressed through language and acoustics, which we refer to as Emotional Mismatch (EMM). EMM patterns differ between symptomatic and euthymic moods. EMM statistics serve as an effective feature for mood recognition, reducing annotation cost while preserving mood identification.

  date: 2022-09-01
  categories: [Emotion Recognition, Text, Speech and Audio, Model Training, Interpretation]
  description: Silence is crucial in speech perception, conveying emphasis and emotion. However, little research has been done on the effect of silence on linguistics and emotion recognition. We present a novel framework that fuses linguistic and silence representations for emotion recognition in naturalistic speech. Two methods to represent silence are investigated, with results showing improved performance. Modeling silence as a token in a transformer language model significantly improves performance on the MSP-Podcast dataset. Analyses show that silence emphasizes the attention of its surrounding words.

  description: Factors affecting explanation efficacy include the algorithm used and the end user. NLP papers focus on algorithms for generating explanations, but overlook other factors. This paper examines how saliency-based explanation methods for machine learning models change with controlled variables. We aim to provide a standardized list of variables to evaluate these explanations and show how SoTA algorithms can have different rankings when controlling for evaluation criteria.

  description: Prompt-based language models introduce uncertainty to classification and require users to try multiple prompts with varying temperatures to find the best fit. However, this approach lacks the ability to capture implicit differences in prompts and provide adequate vocabulary. To address this, a text annotation framework is proposed to provide a structured approach to prompt definition and annotation. Better validation structures and structured prompts are necessary for using prompt-based systems at scale for labeling or retrieval.
